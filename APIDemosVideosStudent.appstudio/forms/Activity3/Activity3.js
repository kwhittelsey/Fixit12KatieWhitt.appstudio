Activity 3: find pizza places with the Google Places API

Create a new request in your Collection. Name it
'Google Places Pizza' in Omaha'. 

Now you will add the information for the request. 
> add the base url as needed (look in the pink line holding the url
  for this section). 
> change 'output' in the url to 'json' as that is the type 
  of output you want.
> remove the placeholder word 'parameters' after the ? in the url
> Add the required parameters: 
   query - add this one: "pizza places in Omaha"
   key (you already have this) - put last
> remove the other parameters that you won't need in this API request. 
> Add Optional parameters
    location - use latitude, longitude of Omaha, NE (look up on Google)
    radius - size of circle around location to report 
 
 In appStudio, how would you access and output to the console
 the name of the third pizza place returned? Assume the data is 
 parsed into a variable named 'results'.

 Show the code for accessing it.
